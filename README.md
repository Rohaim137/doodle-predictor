## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or later
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rohaim137/doodle-predictor.git
cd doodle-predictor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Choose one of the available categories to draw
3. Draw your doodle in the canvas area
   - Keep it simple and centered for better predictions
   - Use clear, distinct lines
4. Click the "Predict" button to see what the AI thinks you've drawn
5. Use the "Clear" button to start over

## Model Information

The prediction model is trained on the [Quick Draw dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) and converted to TensorFlow.js format. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to recognize hand-drawn sketches.
